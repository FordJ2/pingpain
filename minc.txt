ENTIRE MONSTERS INC. TRANSCRIPT
(Int. little boy's bedroom, night, A little boy snuggles into bed as his parents' footsteps fade away down the hall. All is quiet)
(The closet door creaks open. The boy looks around the room nervously, eyes growing wide. Suddenly, he spies a tentacle, emerging from the closet. The boy turns away in fear, but a second look reveals it to be just a shirt sleeve He relaxes back into bed)
(A dark shadow cuts across the bedspread. From under the bed, a pair of evil red eyes peer out)
(Rising up behind the boy, preparing to scare his young victim, towers a fearsome monster.)
(The boy sees the monster and screams)
(The monster, horrified by the child, lets out an even more blood-curdling scream of his own)
(He backs away and slips on a soccer ball, which ricochets off the wall and beans him squarely on the face. He stumbles back onto a skateboard, slips, and lands on a pile of jacks)
(Crazed with pain, the monster runs around the room, screaming and holding his backside)
Computer Voice: chicken nuggies.
(Worklights flash on, flooding the room with light. The boy, now revealed to be an animatronic, winds down and resets. One wall of the bedroom starts to rise, revealing…)

(Int. little boy's bedroom, night)
Mother: Good night, sweethear
Boy: Good night, Mom.
Father: Sleep tight, kiddo.
(The bedroom light clicks off. Soft moonlight illuminates the room. A little boy snuggles into bed as his parents' footsteps fade away down the hall. All is quiet)
(The closet door creaks open. The boy looks around the room nervously, eyes growing wide. Suddenly, he spies a tentacle, emerging from the closet. The boy turns away in fear, but a second look reveals it to be just a shirt sleeve He relaxes back into bed)
(A dark shadow cuts across the bedspread. From under the bed, a pair of evil red eyes peer out)

(The boy sees the monster and screams)
(The monster, horrified by the child, lets out an even more blood-curdling scream of his own)
(He backs away and slips on a soccer ball, which ricochets off the wall and beans him squarely on the face. He stumbles back onto a skateboard, slips, and lands on a pile of jacks)
(Crazed with pain, the monster runs around the room, screaming and holding his backside)
Computer Voice: Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated.
(Worklights flash on, flooding the room with light. The boy, now revealed to be an animatronic, winds down and resets. One wall of the bedroom starts to rise, revealing…)
(INT. SIMULATOR/TRYOUT ROOM, DAY. The bedroom is a set, a simulator where monsters practice their scare tactics)
(Behind a control console sits an evaluator, the dragon-like Ms. Flint. Judging by her tone, she's been through this before)
Flint: All right, Mr. Bile, is it?
Bile: Uh… My friends call me Phlegm.
Flint: Uh-huh. Mr. Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?
Bile: I fell down?
Flint: No, no, before that. Can anyone tell me Mr. Bile's big mistake? Anyone?
(Flint addresses a panel of pathetic looking recruits, seated behind her. They stare back at her blankly)
Flint: (groans) Let's take a look at the tape. Here we go. (Flint rewinds the tape, then plays it)
(ON THE MONITOR: Bile sneaks into the bedroom, leaving the door open. The image freezes)
Flint: Uh, right… Puh-puh-puh-puh… Ah! There, see? The door. You left it wide open.
Recruits: Ooh!
Flint: And leaving the door open is the worst mistake any employee can make because…?
Bile: Um… It could let in a draft?
Waternoose: (off-screen) It could let in a child! (Mr. Waternoose, CEO of Monsters Inc., steps from the shadows)
Flint: Oh! Mr. Waternoose!
Waternoose: There is nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child. A single touch could kill you! (Bile shuffles nervously away from the animatronic kid) Leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory! Right into the monster world! (One recruit loses it, leaping into the lap of the monster next to him)
Recruit: I won't go in a kid's room! You can't make me!
Waternoose: (Waternoose grabs a nearby yellow scream can) You're going in there because we need this. (He uncorks the can, and the sound of children's screams leak out. The lights surge, and monitors crackle. The recruits cover their ears) (Waternoose corks the can) Our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams. Without scream, we have no power. Yes, it's dangerous work and that's why I need you to be at your best. I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough, intimidating. I need scarers like… Like… James P. Sullivan.
(James P. Sullivan, snoring loudly, fast asleep)
(INT. SULLEY'S BEDROOM, MORNING. Sulley is an intimidatingly large big blue monster with horns, sharp teeth and sharp claws) (The clock radio next to him clicks on)
Radio DJ: (off-screen) Hey! Good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 A.M. In the big monster city. (The camera pans over to reveal that the radio announcer is actually Mike, a one-eyed ball of a monster with green frog-like skin, standing casually next to Sulley's bed)
Mike: Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles and, it looks like it's going to be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in or simply... Work out that flab that's hanging over the bed! Get up, Sulley! (Mike puts a bull horn to Sulley's ear. Bwaat!)

Sulley: (screaming)
(INT. LIVING ROOM, MORNING. Sulley drops to the floor for push-ups. Mike stands in front of him barking orders like a coach)
Sulley: I don't believe I ordered a wake-up call, Mikey.
Mike: Hey! Less talk, more pain, marshmallow boy!
(Between the push-up, Sulley springs into the air, striking a fearsome pose and roaring)
Mike: Feel the burn! You call yourself a monster?
Sulley: (roars louder)
(INT. LIVING ROOM. Sulley jogs in place)
Mike: Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet! Oop! The kid's awake!
(Sulley drops to the ground and lies motionless)
Mike: Okay, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet, scary feet...
(Sulley pops back up into a jog)
Mike: Kid's asleep! (Sulley roars)
(INT. LIVING ROOM)
Mike: Twins! In a bunk bed!
(Sulley goes up and down, roaring on two levels)
Mike: Ooh! I thought I had you there.
(INT. LIVING ROOM)
Mike: Okay, Sulley, here we go. You ready? Follow it. (Mike holds a broom with a crude drawing of a child's face taped to the end) Oh! It's over her! Oh, look over there! (Mike swings the broom, Sulley lunges after it) Don't let the kid touch you! Don't let it touch you! (Sulley growls at the paper kid while dodging it)
(INT. LIVING ROOM. Like a quarterback rushing a tackle dummy, Sulley strains to push a pile of heavy furniture across the living room. Mike stands atop the pile him)
Mike: (like a Drill Sergeant) ♪ I don't know, but it's been said, I love scaring kids in bed! ♪
(INT. BATHROOM. Sulley brushes his teeth, while Mike stands on his arm)
Mike: Come on, fight that plaque! Fight that plaque! Scary monsters don't have plaque!
(INT. LIVING ROOM. Sulley hangs upside-down from a beam, doing some "gravity" sit ups)
Mike: 118... Do you have 119? Do I see 120? Oh, I don't believe it!
Sulley: I'm not even breaking a sweat.
Mike: Not you! Look! The new commercial's on! (Mike runs to the TV. Sulley slips and falls)
(CLOSE ON TV. a bank of lights illuminate and flare brightly)
Announcer: The future is bright at Monsters Incorporated.
(Sulley and Mike scramble into their chairs to watch the commercial)
Mike: I'm in this one!
(CLOSEUP ON TV. Beautiful shots of monsters happily living their lives)
Announcer: We're part of your life. We power your car. We warm your home. We light your city.
(An M.I. worker turns to the camera)
Worker #1: I'm Monsters Incorporated.
Sulley: (watches from his easy chair, pointing at screen) Hey, look! Betty!
(CLOSE ON TV. A bored child watches as various monsters cycle past. We settle on one which causes the child to scream)
Announcer: Carefully matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on Monsters, Incorporated, is there.
Floor Manager: (to camera) I'm Monsters Incorporated!
(A child vacantly staring at a television set. Machine gun fire, explosions, etc. are heard emerging from the set)
(Text appears on the screen: "SIMULATION-NOT ACTUAL CHILD)
Announcer: We know the challenge, the window of innocence is shrinking. Human kids are harder to scare.
(Henry J. Waternoose, a large crab-like monster, turns to face the camera, turns to face the camera)
(Super: CEO HENRY J. WATERNOOSE, C.E.O.)
Waternoose: (On TV) Of course, M.I. is prepared for the future with the top scarers...
(On the screen, Sulley stands next to a door standing on a factory work floor. He leans through a door and roars like a lion. The kid inside screams)
Mike: (watches his buddy on TV and leaps to his feet) Woo hoo-hoo!
Waternoose: (On TV) ...the best refineries and research into new energy techniques.
(A monster with virtual reality glasses roars, causing a computer child on a monitor behind him to scream.)
Mike: (re: commercial) Okay, here I come.
(CLOSE ON TV. Sulley and Mike stand in front of a crowd of MI workers. As they turn to camera, the Monsters Inc. logo appears over Mike, blocking him entirely)
Sulley: We're working for a better tomorrow... today!
(Mike stares at the television, shocked)
Workers: We're Monsters Incorporated!
Waternoose: We're M.I.-- Monsters Incorporated. We scare because we care.
(Sulley turns off the TV)
Mike: I can't believe it.
Sulley: (consoling) Oh, Mike...
Mike: I was on TV! Did you see me? I'm a natural!
(The phone rings. Mike grabs the receiver)
Mike: (into phone) Hello. I know! Hey, wasn't I great? Did the whole family see it? (to Sulley) It's your mom. (to phone) What can I say? The camera loves me.
( bicycle bell rings )
Mike: I'm telling you, big daddy you're going to be seeing this face on TV a lot more often.
Sulley: Yeah? Like, on Monstroplis is most wanted?
( mocking laughter )
Mike: You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade, pal.
Have a good day, sweetie.
You, too, hon.
Mike: Whoo! Okay, Sulley, hop on in.
Sulley: Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Mike: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where you going? What are you doing?
Sulley: Mikey, there's a scream shortage. We're walking.
Mike: Walking?
Sulley: Yep.
Mike: No, no, no, my baby!
Sulley: Come on! Come on!
Mike: Look, she needs to be driven!
Bye, baby. I... I'll call you!
Hey, genius, you want to know why I bought the car? Huh?
Sulley: Not really.
Mike: To drive it!
You know, like, on the street?
With the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom
and no walking involved.
( mock whining )
Sulley: Give it a rest, will ya, butterball? Come on, you could use the exercise.
Mike: I could use the exercise?!
Look at you. You have your own climate!
Girl monsters: How many tentacles jump the rope?
Boy monster: Morning, Mike! Morning, Sulley!
Sulley: Hey! Morning, kids.
Mike: Hey, kids.
Sulley: How you doing?
Bye, Mike! Bye, Sulley!
Big eye: Ow! Hey!

Celia: Okay, sweetheart.

YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID?
Celia: (coy) What did you say?
Mike: I said...
Mike: Sulley?
Celia: Sulley?
Mike: No! No, no.
That's not what I was going to say.
Celia: Mike, you're not making sense.
Sulley: Hi, guys! What a coincidence, running into you here! Uh, I'm just going to order something to go.
Celia: (annoyed) Michael...
Mike: (through gritted teeth) Sulley!
Sulley: I wonder what's good here.
Mike: Get out of here! You're ruining everything!
Sulley: I went back to get your paperwork and there was a door.

Celia: ( sighs )
Mike: ( gasps )

Sushi Chef: There's a kid here-- a human kid! (exclaiming in baby talk)
Celia: Googley Bear!
(yelling)
Boo: (blows raspberry)
Sulley: Come on!
(monsters screaming in terror)
Mike: Let's get out of here!
CDA helicopter pilot: Please remain calm. This not a drill.
(siren wailing, tires screeching)
CDA Agent #1: We have an 835 in progress. Please advise.
Celia: Michael? Michael!
Mike: Oh, Celia!
Please come with me.
Celia: Ow! Stop pushing!
Mike: Hey, get your hands off my Schmoopsie-Poo!
Building clear. Ready for decontamination.
Mike: Well, I don't think that date could have gone any worse!
( explosion )
( electrical buzzing )
(INT. NIGHTLY TELEVISION NEWS SET. The same image of the restaurant becomes part of a news report, with the word, "KID-TASTROPHE!" superimposed over it)
(A NEWSCASTER talks to camera)
Newscaster: If witnesses are to be believed there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history.
(EXT. SUSHI RESTAURANT, NIGHT. A CDA agent stands in front of the smoldering sushi restaurant. A microphone is thrust in his face)
CDA Agent: We can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight.
(EXT. STREET/SIDEWALK. With chaos behind them, panicked Monsters speaks into camera)
Misc Monster #1: Well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision!
Misc Monster #2: I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll!
(A monster with dozens of eyes steps forward to corroborate)
Misc Monster #3: It's true! I saw the whole thing!
(CLOSE ON TV)
(INT. NIGHTLY TELEVISION NEWS SET. A SCIENTIST sits next to the anchor)
Scientist: It is my professional opinion that now is the time to... panic!
(INT. Mike and Sulley's living room, night. Crash! Mike and Sulley's TV smashes to the floor. Boo's head peeks out over the set)
Boo: Oh-oh.
(Sulley and Mike wear COLANDERS, SNORKELS MASKS, and OVER MITTS for protection. They see the kid and scream, scrambling behind a chair for protection)
Mike: Oh, it's coming! It's coming!
Boo: (giggling) Boo!
Mike & Sulley (Both): (both screaming)
(Sulley and Mike flee over to the window while knocking down a big lamp. Outside, helicopters scan the area. Hurriedly Mike and Sulley yank the shades closed)
(Boo totters towards them, babbling. Mike and Sulley retreat in fear)
Mike & Sulley (Both): (yelling)
(Boo opens one of the window shade, standing in full view of the helicopters outside)
(Mike scoots her out of view using a broom, then sprays the area with disinfectant)
(Meanwhile Boo has discovered Mike's CD collection, neatly arranged in two stacks)
Mike: No, no, no, no, no!
Come here, kid!
No, don't touch those, you little...!
(The stacks come crashing down)
Mike: Oh, now those were alphabetized. It's okay, it's all right. As long as it doesn't come near us we're going to be okay.
(Boo sneezes directly in Mike's eye)
Mike: (screams)
(Mike freaks, spraying disinfectant squarely into his own eye!)
(yelling in pain)
(Now Boo approaches Sulley. Whimpering, he protects himself with a garbage can lid)
(Boo points to a one eyed teddy bear, out of her reach)
Sulley: Oh, you like this? Fetch!
(Sulley tosses the bear across the room. Boo runs after it)
(She picks up the bear and hugs it. Mike gasps. This has gone too far)
Mike: Hey, hey, that's it! No one touches little Mikey!
(Mike swipes the bear out of Boo's hands. Stunned, her face begins to redden, and her eyes well up with TEARS)
Sulley: Mike, give her the bear.
Mike: Oh, no.
(Boo screams at the top of her lungs causing the LIGHTS in their APARTMENT to SURGE IN SINK, along with LOUD ELECTRICAL NOISE)
(Sulley and Mike cover their ears looking around confused and what to do)
(The camera pans in on each light surging)
(EXT. MIKE AND SULLEY'S APARTMENT, NIGHT. From outside, the apartment lights PULSE BRIGHTLY, creating a beacon for the helicopters. Boo's CRYING is heard)
(INT. APARTMENT. The camera zooms in on Boo crying. From a different view, looking at the window and the fallen lamp surging, one helicopter shines its light on their window as their lights dim at the lowest voltage. The circling helicopters head towards them)
Mike and Sulley: (screaming) AHH!
(Mike drops the bear and runs to the window, pulling one of the shades shut)
Mike: Make it stop, Sulley! Make it stop!
(Boo continues to wail as the lights surge at a higher voltage. Desperate, Sulley offers her the bear)
Sulley: Look! See the bear? (Boo stops crying for about two seconds causing the LIGHTS to STOP SURGING, along with the ELECTRICAL NOISE) Ooh, nice bear.
(It's not working -- she starts to cry louder while the LIGHTS SURGE BRIGHTER. The helicopters are getting closer.)
Mike: Sulley!
(Desperate, Sulley begins to dance with the bear; anything to get her to stop crying and the lights surging)
Sulley: See? Ooh, bear, ooh. Oh, he's a happy bear. ♪ He's not crying, neither should you ♪ Or we'll be in trouble (Boo's crying LESSENS as the lights surge DECREASES) ♪ 'Cause they're gonna find us (Boo finally STOPS CRYING CAUSING the LIGHTS to STOP SURGING) ♪ So please stop crying right now ♪
(Everything returns to normal including the electricity voltage)
Mike: Good, good, Sulley. Keep it up. You're doing great.
(The helicopters turn around and begin to fly away)
(Boo's quiet listening to Sulley sing)
Sulley: ♪ Ooh, the happy bear, he has no... ♪
(Boo reaches for the bear, accidentally touching Sulley's hand. He screams)
Sulley: (screaming) She touched me!
(Sulley's yelling frightens the kid, who starts crying again, hoping it was over)
(The LIGHTS SURGE yet AGAIN. Mike starts yelling to Sulley)
Mike: Sulley, the bear! The bear! (Mike runs from the window towards Sulley) Give her the...
(Just as Mike says the last word before he trips, Boo STOPS CRYING and the LIGHTS STOP SURGING once AGAIN)
(Mike trips on their fallen lamp while his right flipper comes off and flies across the floor)
Whoa!
(Sulley attempts to catch Mike with his hands and misses. Boo and Sulley look on as he passes them)
(Mike rolls into a garbage can and bumps into a shelf, sending a STACK OF BOOKS into his mouth. A hanging STEREO SPEAKER lands on his head)
Oof!
(Everything goes QUIET for a moment the third time, realizing it may not be over yet)
(Boo thinks this is hilarious and begins LAUGHING all of a SUDDEN. The lights in the apartment SURGE AGAIN while it GLOWS EVEN BRIGHTER than before. The glow makes it hard to view their apartment)
(EXT. MIKE AND SULLEY'S APARTMENT, NIGHT. The region lit up by the laugh's power radiates outwards from Mike and Sulley's window. In a moment ALL THE APARTMENT WINDOWS are GLOWING BRIGHTLY)
(INT. APARTMENT. The VOLTAGE continues to increase until the lights flare to a white-hot brightness, and then POP)
(The laughter subsides, and all is dark)
Sulley: What was that?
(Mike is still wedged inside the garbage can)
Mike: I have no idea, but it would be really great if it didn't do it again.
(Boo giggles again)
Sulley: Shh, shh, shh.
(She seems to understand. She nods and holds her tiny finger up to her mouth)
Boo: Shh...
Sulley: Shh.
Boo: Shh...
(She smiles)
(Things finally return to normal peacefully except with their power outage)
Sulley: HOW COULD I DO THIS? HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?
THIS COULD DESTROY THE COMPANY.
Mike: THE COMPANY? WHO CARES ABOUT THE COMPANY?!
WHAT ABOUT US?
THAT THING IS A KILLING MACHINE!
Boo: ♪ La-La-La-La-La-La ♪
Mike: I BET IT'S JUST WAITING FOR US TO FALL ASLEEP AND THEN WHAM!
OH, WE'RE EASY PREY, MY FRIEND-- EASY PREY.
WE'RE SITTING TARGETS.
Okay, look, I think I have a plan here.
Using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city
and release it into the wild.
Sulley: Spoons.
Mike: That's it, I'm out of ideas. We're closed.
Hot air balloon? Too expensive.
Giant slingshot? Too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse? Too Greek!
Boo: ( speaking baby talk )
Mike: (muttering to self) NO PLAN. NO PLAN. CAN'T THINK. CAN'T THINK. FLATLINING.
Sulley: UH, MIKE? I THINK SHE'S GETTING TIRED.
Mike: WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU FIND SOMEPLACE FOR IT TO SLEEP? WHILE I THINK OF A PLAN!
Sulley: ARE YOU SLEEPY? YOU WANT TO SLEEP? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? HUH?
(crunching)
Sulley: OKAY, ALL RIGHT. I'M MAKING A NICE LITTLE AREA FOR YOU TO...
Boo: (giggling)
Sulley: NO. HEY, HEY, THAT'S MY BED!
YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR GERMS ALL OVER IT!
( sighing ) FINE.
MY CHAIR IS MORE COMFORTABLE ANYWAY.
Boo: ( yells )
Sulley: WHAT?
Boo: ( speaking fearfully )
Sulley: IT'S JUST A CLOSET. WILL YOU GO TO SLEEP?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall's your monster.
YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO COME THROUGH THE CLOSET AND SCARE YOU.
OH, BOY, HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS? UH, IT'S EMPTY.
SEE?
AH!
Sulley: NO MONSTER IN HERE.
WELL, NOW THERE IS
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SCARE YOU.
I'M OFF-DUTY.
OKAY.
HOW ABOUT I SIT HERE, UNTIL YOU FALL ASLEEP?
GO AHEAD. GO TO SLEEP. NOW.
NOW... GO.
UH, YOU... GO...
TO... SLEEP.
( imitating snoring )
( giggles )
( sighs in relief )
( door creaks softly )
Sulley: Hey, Mike, this might sound crazy
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
Mike: Really? Well, in that case, let's keep it.
I always wanted a pet that could kill me!
Sulley: NOW, LOOK. WHAT IF WE JUST PUT HER BACK IN HER DOOR?
Mike: WHAT?
Sulley: MIKE, THINK ABOUT IT.
IF WE SEND HER BACK, IT'S LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.
EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO NORMAL.
Mike: IS THAT A JOKE? TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.
SULLEY, I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES
I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY FORGIVING UP TO NOW
BUT THAT IS A HORRIBLE IDEA! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
MARCH RIGHT OUT INTO PUBLIC WITH THAT THING?
THEN I GUESS WE JUST WALTZ RIGHT UP TO THE FACTORY, RIGHT?
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE WALTZING RIGHT UP TO THE FACTORY.
SULLEY, A MOP, A COUPLE OF LIGHTS AND SOME CHAIR FABRIC
ARE NOT GOING TO FOOL ANYONE!
JUST THINK ABOUT A FEW NAMES, WILL YOU?
LOCH NESS, BIGFOOT, THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN--
THEY ALL GOT ONE THING IN COMMON, PAL-- BANISHMENT.
WE COULD BE NEXT!
Sulley: DON'T PANIC-- WE CAN DO THIS.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING, FRANK?
HEY, GUYS.
Sulley: EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY. ( gasping )
( equipment buzzing loudly )
NUMBER ONE WANTS THIS PLACE DUSTED FOR PRINTS.
CAREFUL WITH THAT.
I GOT A GOOD VIEW FROM HERE.
A LITTLE LOWER.
THIS WAS RECOVERED AT THE SCENE.
Sulley: DON'T PANIC.
Mike: DON'T TELL ME NOT TO PANIC.
Sulley: JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER.
Mike: EVERYTHING IS NOT OKAY!
Boo: BOO.
...COULD BE CONTAMINATED.
Waternoose: GENTLEMEN, SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT... NOT NOW, NOT NOW.
OH, HELLO, LITTLE ONE. WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?
Sulley: MR. WATERNOOSE!
Waternoose: AH, JAMES! IS THIS ONE YOURS?
Sulley: ACTUALLY, THAT'S MY, UH, COUSIN'S SISTER'S DAUGHTER, SIR.
Mike: YEAH, IT'S, UH...
"BRING AN OBSCURE RELATIVE TO WORK DAY."
Waternoose: HMM, MUST HAVE MISSED THE MEMO. WELL, LISTEN, JAMES, WHY DON'T YOU STOP BY THE SIMULATOR AFTER LUNCH TODAY AND GIVE US THAT SCARE DEMONSTRATION WE TALKED ABOUT, HUH?
Sulley: OH, OH, SIR, UH....
EXCUSE ME, MR. WATERNOOSE?
Waternoose: YES, YES, I'M COMING.
ALL RIGHT THEN, I'LL SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON, JAMES.
THAT IS, IF THESE GENTLEMEN HAVEN'T SHUT US DOWN.
Sulley: OH, BOY.
Mike: OH, A SCARE DEMO.
WELL, THAT IS GREAT. WHY AM I THE LAST TO KNOW? WE CAN BRING YOUR COUSIN'S SISTER'S DAUGHTER ALONG.
SHE'LL BE A BIG HIT! ( equipment buzzing loudly ) HALT! ( yelling ) STOP HIM! HOLD HIM DOWN.
Mike: COME ON, THE COAST IS CLEAR.
OKAY, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET RID OF THAT THING.
SO, WAIT HERE WHILE I GET ITS CARD KEY.
Sulley: BUT SHE CAN'T STAY HERE. THIS IS THE MEN'S ROOM.
Mike: THAT IS THE WEIRDEST THING YOU HAVE EVER SAID.
IT'S FINE. IT'S OKAY. LOOK, IT LOVES IT HERE!
IT'S DANCING WITH JOY!
Boo: UH, UH, UH, UH.
Mike: I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH ITS DOOR KEY.
Sulley: ( laughs )
THAT'S A CUTE LITTLE DANCE YOU'VE GOT.
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT TO...
( whining )
Sulley: OH.
( singing in baby talk )
( singing stops )
Sulley: UH, ARE YOU DONE IN THERE?
Boo: ( squeals )
Sulley: AH! SORRY. SORRY.
( singing )
( toilet flushes )
Sulley: OKAY, YOU FINISHED NOW, RIGHT? HELLO?
( yells )
Boo: BOO.
( giggles )
Sulley: ( sighs )
( giggling )
( chuckles )
Sulley: WHERE DID SHE GO?
OH, DID SHE DISAPPEAR?
DID SHE TURN INVISIBLE?
( giggling softly )
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA.
Sulley: GOTCHA!
Boo: BOO.
( giggles )
Sulley: HEY, YOU'RE GOOD.
(sighs)
Mike: Be relaxed, be relaxed, be relaxed.
Roz, my tender, blossom, you're looking fabulous today. IS THAT A NEW HAIRCUT? COME ON, TELL ME.
It's a new haircut, isn't it?
That's got to be a new haircut.
New makeup? You've had a lift.
You've had a tuck. You've had something?
Something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...
(sighs) Listen, I need a favor.
Randall was working late last night out on the scare floor.
I really need the key to the door he was using.
Roz: Well, isn't that nice? But guess what? You didn't turn in your paperwork last night.
Mike: He didn't... I... no paperwork?
Roz: This office is now closed.
Mike: ( Mike screams in pain )
Sulley: READY OR NOT, HERE I COME! I'M GETTING WARMER. ANY SECOND NOW. FEE FI FO...
Mike: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
Sulley: I-I'M LOOKING FOR THE KID.
Mike: YOU LOST IT?!
Sulley: NO, NO, SHE WAS JUST....
( squeals )
Sulley: HERE SHE IS.
( whining )
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
Randall: I ALREADY TOLD YOUR BUDDIES I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING.
CDA AGENT: ALL RIGHT, CARRY ON.
( splashing )
Fungus: Randall!
Randall: Aah!
Fungus: THANK GOODNESS!
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE CHILD?
Randall: SHH!
SHH, SHH, SHH.
( door slams open )
( door slams open )
Fungus: THE FRONT PAGE! IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE.
THE CHILD-- THE ONE YOU WERE AFTER.
Randall: WILL YOU BE QUIET?!
DON'T YOU THINK I'M AWARE OF THE SITUATION?
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT TRYING TO FIND IT.
Fungus: I DID A SIMPLE CALCULATION
FACTORING IN THE SIZE OF THE SUSHI RESTAURANT.
THE CHILD MAY HAVE ESCAPED!
Randall: YEAH, WELL, UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE
WE'RE GOING TO ACT LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED, UNDERSTAND?
YOU JUST GET THE MACHINE UP AND RUNNING.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE KID.
AND WHEN I FIND WHOEVER LET IT OUT, THEY'RE DEAD!
OH!
Randall: WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? COME ON, GO!
MOVE! NOW!
Fungus: OW, OW! I'M NOT HERE.
Sulley: (WHISPERING) They're gone.
( squeaking and splashing )
BOO: Ew.
Mike: THIS IS BAD. THIS IS SO VERY BAD.
Sulley: WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT A MACHINE?
Mike: WHO CARES? OH!
Sulley: LOOK, DON'T PANIC-- ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS CALL HER DOOR DOWN AND SEND HER HOME.
Mike: YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'RE JUST TWO REGULAR JOES ON OUR WAY TO WORK.
WE WILL BLEND RIGHT IN.
Sulley: TOP OF THE MORNIN', FELLAS!
Mike: HEY, WHAT'S SHAKIN', BACON?
Sulley: DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT? OR A LIMB?
YOU HAVE HER CARD KEY, RIGHT?
Mike: OF COURSE.
I TOLD YOU I'D GET HER CARD KEY.
I WENT AND GOT HER CARD KEY
AND NOW I HAVE HER CARD KEY.
Mike: OKAY, HERE WE GO.
Sulley: TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
TRY NOT TO RUN THROUGH ANY MORE CLOSETS.
( giggles )
Sulley: Mike, that's not her door.
Mike: What are you talking about?
Of course it's her door. It's her door.
Sulley: No, her door was white and it had flowers on it.
Mike: NO. IT MUST HAVE BEEN DARK LAST NIGHT
BECAUSE THIS IS ITS DOOR.
( polka music playing )
Mike: HEY, YOU HEAR THAT?
SOUNDS LIKE FUN IN THERE!
OKAY, SEND ME A POSTCARD, KID.
THAT'S MIKE WAZOWSKI, CARE OF
22 MIKE-WAZOWSKI- YOU-GOT-YOUR-LIFE-BACK LANE.
Boo: Mowki Kowski.
Mike: Very good. Now bon voyage! Bye-bye! Come on. Look at the stick. See the stick? Go get the stick! Go fetch.
Sulley: MIKE, THIS ISN'T BOO'S DOOR.
Mike: BOO? WHAT'S BOO?
Sulley: THAT'S WHAT I DECIDED TO CALL HER.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
Mike: SULLEY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO NAME IT.
ONCE YOU NAME IT, YOU START GETTING ATTACHED TO IT!
NOW PUT THAT THING
BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM, OR SO HELP ME...

WHAT'D YOU DO WITH IT?
Sulley: ( gasps ) WHERE IS SHE?
Mike: I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
SHE GOT AWAY FROM YOU AGAIN?!
WELL, THAT IS JUST...
WAIT A MINUTE. THE SUN IS COMING UP.
THIS IS PERFECT! SHE'S GONE!
Mike: HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
Mike: SULLEY, PLEASE, DON'T BLOW THIS.
NOT WHEN WE'RE SO CLOSE TO BREAKING THE RECORD.
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL FIND THE KID.
IT'LL BE THEIR PROBLEM, NOT OURS!
SHE'S OUT OF OUR HAIR!
Randall: WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?
THEY'RE REHEARSING A PLAY.
Mike: ♪ SHE'S OUT OF OUR HAIR! ♪
Randall: CAN IT, WAZOWSKI!
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT KID GETTING OUT, SULLIVAN?
PRETTY CRAZY, HUH?
Sulley: OH, YEAH, CRAZY.

Sulley: UH, WELL, UH...
Mike: NO, NO WAY!
BUT IF IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB

Randall: Hey, Waxford!
Mike: Sulley!
Celia: Michael Wazowski!

Celia: Last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!
( hissing )
I thought you cared about me.
Mike: Honey, please.
Schmoopsie, I thought you liked sushi.
Celia: Sushi? Sushi?!
You think this is about sushi?!
Randall: Wazowski!
Celia: Michael! Mike...

Mike: BREATHE. KEEP BREATHING.
WHEW.
YIKES!
Randall: WHERE'S THE KID?
Mike: KID? WHAT KID?
Randall: IT'S HERE IN THE FACTORY, ISN'T IT?
Mike: YOU'RE NOT PINNING THIS ON ME.
IT NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN CHEATING LAST NIGHT!
Randall: CHEATING?
CHEATING. RIGHT.
OKAY, I THINK I KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS ALL GO AWAY.
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WHISTLE BLOWS IN 5 MINUTES?
Mike: UH... I GET A TIME-OUT?
Randall: EVERYONE GOES TO LUNCH!
WHICH MEANS THE SCARE FLOOR WILL BE...?
Mike: PAINTED?
Randall: EMPTY! IT'LL BE EMPTY, YOU IDIOT!

WHEN THE BIG HAND IS POINTING UP
AND THE LITTLE HAND IS POINTING UP
THE KID'S DOOR WILL BE IN MY STATION.

Mike: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S CREE-TIN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO THREATEN ME DO IT PROPERLY.
SECOND OF ALL, YOU'RE NUTS IF YOU THINK KIDNAPPING ME
IS GOING TO HELP YOU CHEAT YOUR WAY TO THE TOP!

Randall: You still think this about that stupid scare record?
Mike: WELL... I DID, RIGHT UP UNTIL YOU CHUCKLED LIKE THAT.
AND NOW I'M THINKING I SHOULD JUST GET OUTTA HERE.
Randall: I AM ABOUT TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE SCARING INDUSTRY
AND WHEN I DO, EVEN THE GREAT JAMES P. SULLIVAN

Mike: WELL, SOMEBODY'S CERTAINLY BEEN A BUSY BEE.
Randall: FIRST, I NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE KID IS

Randall: OH, FOR...
WHAT DID YOU DO WRONG THIS TIME?
Fungus: I DON'T KNOW. I CALIBRATED THE DRIVE...
Randall: GO CHECK THE MACHINE!
Fungus: THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SCREAM INTAKE VALVE.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THESE 3250 UNITS...
Randall: HUH?
HMM.
Mike: PSST!
FUNGUS. FUNGUS.
YOU LIKE CARS, HUH?
'CAUSE I GOT A REALLY NICE CAR.
IF YOU LET ME GO, I'LL GIVE YOU...

Sulley: Come on!
Mike: THIS IS CRAZY. HE'S GOING TO KILL US!
CDA Agent 1: CAREFUL. THAT COULD BE CONTAMINATED.
Mike: We got to get out of here now! We can start a whole new life somewhere far away! Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.! Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!
Sulley: No, Mike, wait!
Mike: Hey, What are you doing?
Sulley: Follow me! I have an idea!
Mike: No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Computer voice: ( over P.A. ) Simulation terminated.
Waternoose: No, no, no, no, no! What was that? You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep!
Bile: I was going for a snake/ninja approach with a little hissing. ( hisses )
Waternoose: How many times do I have to tell you? It's all about presence! About How you enter the room!
Sulley: Mr. Waternoose!
Waternoose: James! Perfect timing!
Sulley: No, no, no. Sir, you don't understand.
Waternoose: Ah, now, show these monsters how it's done.
Sulley: What? No, no, I can't... Sir, you have to listen to me.
Mike: Eeh!
Waternoose: Pay attention, everyone! You're about to see the best in the business! Reset the simulator.
Sulley: But-But, sir!

Mike: SIR, SHE ISN'T TOXIC.
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT TRUST ME.
Sulley: BOO?
NO, NO, NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.
I WAS JUST...
( whimpering in fear )
Sulley: NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, DON'T BE SCARED.
THAT WASN'T REAL. IT'S JUST A...
I WAS JUST...
( crying ): NO...
( Boo continues crying )
( Boo sobbing )
Sulley: BOO.
Mike: ...and he was going to test it out on that sweet, little girl.
NOW THAT WE HAVE HER...
Sulley: BOO.
Mike: ...HE IS TRYING TO KILL US.
THIS WHOLE THING IS RANDALL'S FAULT.
Waternoose: RANDALL?
Mike: YES. AND WE CAN TAKE YOU TO HIS SECRET LAB,
WHICH IS RIGHT HERE IN THIS FACTORY.
Waternoose: HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? OH, HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW ABOUT THIS?
Mike: No, sir.
Waternoose: Good.
THIS COMPANY CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE BAD PUBLICITY.
NOW, BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING ELSE, LET'S...
TAKE CARE OF THE CHILD.
OH, I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS WOULD COME TO THIS...
NOT IN MY FACTORY.
I'M SORRY YOU BOYS GOT MIXED UP IN THIS.
ESPECIALLY YOU, JAMES.
BUT NOW WE CAN SET
EVERYTHING STRAIGHT AGAIN FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMPANY.

No! No!
No! No! No! No!

Mike: It's too late! We're banished, genius. We're in the HUMAN WORLD! [sarcastically] Oh, what a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose! Too bad he was in on the whole thing! All you had to do was listen to me JUST ONCE! But you didn't, did you?! [explodes with rage] YOU'RE STILL NOT LISTENING!

Yeti: WHY CAN'T THEY CALL ME THE ADORABLE SNOWMAN OR...OR THE AGREEABLE SNOWMAN, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD?
I'M A NICE GUY. SNOW CONE?
Mike: YUCK.
Yeti: NO, NO, NO.
DON'T WORRY-- IT'S LEMON.
UH, HOW ABOUT YOU, BIG FELLA?
SNOW CONE?
Sulley: DID YOU SEE THE WAY SHE... LOOKED AT ME?
( sighs )
Yeti: AH, POOR GUY.
I UNDERSTAND.
Yeti: IT AIN'T EASY BEING BANISHED.
TAKE MY BUDDY, BIGFOOT. WHEN HE WAS BANISHED
HE FASHIONED AN ENORMOUS DIAPER OUT OF POISON IVY.
WORE IT ON HIS HEAD LIKE A TIARA.
CALLED HIMSELF KING ITCHY.
Yeti: AH, IT WON'T BE SO HARD FOR YOU GUYS, THOUGH, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, HOW LUCKY CAN YOU GET?
BANISHED WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND.
Mike: HE IS NOT MY FRIEND.
Yeti: OH. I JUST ASSUMED YOU WERE BUDDIES, YOU KNOW
WHEN I SAW YOU OUT THERE IN THE SNOW
HUGGING AND ALL THAT.
Mike: LOOK AT THAT BIG JERK.
RUINED MY LIFE, AND FOR WHAT?
A STUPID KID!
BECAUSE OF YOU, I AM NOW STUCK
IN THIS FROZEN WASTELAND!
Yeti: WASTELAND?
I THINK YOU MEAN WONDERLAND!
I MEAN, HOW ABOUT ALL THIS FABULOUS SNOW, HUH?
OH, AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE LOCAL VILLAGE.
CUTEST THING IN THE WORLD.
I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED ALL THE FREE YAK'S MILK.
Sulley: WHAT... WHAT DID YOU SAY?
Yeti: YAK'S MILK.
MILKING A YAK AIN'T EXACTLY A PICNIC.
YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU PICK THE HAIRS OUT
IT'S VERY NUTRITIOUS.
Sulley: NO, NO. SOMETHING ABOUT A VILLAGE.
WHERE? ARE THERE KIDS IN IT?
Yeti: KIDS? SURE.
TOUGH KIDS, SISSY KIDS, KIDS WHO CLIMB ON ROCKS...
Sulley: WHERE IS IT?!
Yeti: IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN.
AROUND A THREE-DAY HIKE.
Sulley: OH, THREE DAYS?!
WE NEED TO GET THERE NOW!
( thump )
( ding )
Yeti: YOU WANT TO GO TO THE VILLAGE?
OKAY, RULE NUMBER ONE OUT HERE.
ALWAYS... NO.
NEVER GO OUT IN A BLIZZARD.
Sulley: WE NEED TO GET TO BOO.
( grunts, then gasps )
Mike: BOO?! WHAT ABOUT US?
( grunts )
Mike: EVER SINCE THAT KID CAME IN,
YOU'VE IGNORED EVERYTHING I'VE SAID
AND NOW LOOK WHERE WE ARE!
OH, WE WERE ABOUT TO BREAK THE RECORD, SULLEY.
WE WOULD HAVE HAD IT MADE!
Sulley: NONE OF THAT MATTERS NOW.
Mike: NONE OF IT MATTER...
WA-WAIT A SECOND.
NONE OF IT MATTERS?
( sighs )
Okay.
THAT'S.... NO. GOOD. GREAT.
SO, NOW THE TRUTH COMES OUT, DOESN'T IT?
Yeti: OH, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
WE'RE OUT OF SNOW CONES, UH...
LET ME... JUST GO OUTSIDE
AND MAKE SOME MORE.
Mike: SULLEY, WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING WE EVER WORKED FOR?
DOES THAT MATTER? HUH?
AND WHAT ABOUT CELIA?
I AM NEVER... NEVER GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN.
DOESN'T THAT MATTER?
( sighs )
WHAT ABOUT ME?
I'M YOUR PAL.
I'M... I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.
DON'T I MATTER?
( sighs )
Sulley: I'M SORRY, MIKE.
I'M SORRY WE'RE STUCK OUT HERE.
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.
BUT BOO'S IN TROUBLE.
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO SAVE HER
IF WE CAN JUST GET DOWN TO THAT...
Mike: "WE"?
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. "WE"?
NO. THERE'S NO "WE" THIS TIME, PAL.
IF-IF-IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT THERE
AND FREEZE TO DEATH
YOU BE MY GUEST...
BECAUSE YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

Sulley: Hold on!
(INT. SCARE FLOOR. Waternoose stands at an EMPTY DOOR STATION with Boo's card key in his claw. (He addresses a group of CDA agents))
Waternoose: When the door lands in this station, cut the power. You'll have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess. (Boo's door sails out of the vault corridor and into the Scare Floor. Sulley, Mike and Boo peek out from behind the door and see Waternoose and the CDA agents below)
Mike: (stage whisper) Great. A welcoming committee! What are we going to do? (Sulley has an idea) (The door lands in the station. The power shuts off)
CDA Agent: This is the CDA. Come out slowly with the child in plain sight.
(Mike emerges from behind the door, carrying Boo)
Mike: Okay, okay. You got us. Here we are. Here's the kid. I'm cooperating. But before you take us away, I have one thing to say: (Mike sticks his tongue out. There's a sock on it!) (throwing sock) Catch! (It lands on an agent in the middle of the pack!) (The frenzied CDA agents pounce on the agent with the sock)
CDA Agents: (All shouting) 2319! We have a toxic projectile!
(Mike takes off, carrying Boo. The CDA agents see this and chase after them)
CDA Agent #1: Halt! After the suspect!
CDA Agent #2: Cover the area! Bring in reinforcements!
(Waternoose takes up the rear)
Waternoose: Stop him! (As the commotion clears, Sulley peeks out from behind Boo's door. Boo is with him, now out of her disguise and wearing only one sock) (Sulley pops her door out of its station and heads for the exit)
Sulley: Come on.
(Waternoose hurries after the CDA agents)
Waternoose: (re: Mike and Boo) Don't let them get away! What...? (CLANG! Waternoose spins around to see Sulley, who has knocked over a stack of cans during his escape. Sulley scoops up Boo and her door and heads for the door)
Waternoose: (calling to CDA) No, wait, wait! Come back! He has the child! (It's no use, the agents have already disappeared after Mike) (Something SNAPS. Waternoose lunges after Sulley like a wild animal)
(INT. MI HALLWAY. Sulley races down the hall, with Boo in one arm, and her door in the other. Waternoose clambers after them, closing in)
Waternoose: Sullivan! Sullivan! Give me the child!
Boo: Me not go!
Waternoose: Give her to me!
(INT. SIMULATOR TRYOUT ROOM. Sulley bursts through the door of the Simulator Room, Waternoose close behind) (Sulley breaks a pipe off the wall and slides it through the door handles just as Waternoose SLAMS against the door) (Sulley lends the pipe around the handles to secure it) (He frantically removes the door currently in the station)
Waternoose: Open this door! Open this door! (Sulley replaces the simulator door with Boo's door)
Waternoose: Sullivan!
Boo: (yells)
Waternoose: Don't do it! (Sulley pushes a button on the door station keypad, picks Boo up and runs inside)
Sulley: Come on. (Sulley looks back at Waternoose)
Waternoose: (screaming) Don't go in that room! (Sulley closes the closet door behind him. Waternoose yells and beats against the Tryout Room door)
(INT. BOO'S ROOM. Sulley stands over the bed, tucking in the sheets)
Sulley: I think we stopped him, Boo. You're safe now. You be a good girl, okay? (SLAM! Sulley turns to see Waternoose standing in the room, closing the door behind him)
Waternoose: This has gone far enough, James. (Sulley stands protectively in front of the bed)
Sulley: She's home now! Just leave her alone!
Waternoose: I can't do that! She's seen too much. You both have.
Sulley: It doesn't have to be this way!
Waternoose: I have no choice! Times have changed. Scaring isn't enough anymore! (Waternoose closes in on Sulley, raising up on his crab legs intimidatingly)
Sulley: But kidnapping children?
Waternoose: I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die, and I'll silence anyone who gets in my way! (Waternoose smacks Sulley, sending him flying to the floor)
Sulley: No! (Waternoose grabs Boo from the bed)
Boy: Good night, Mom.
Mother: Good night, sweetheart. Waternoose: What is this? What? Who? Huh? (Waternoose blinks, uncomprehending. The child isn't Boo at all, but the Animatronic Kid from the simulator) (The wall of the bedroom begins to rise) COMPUTER: Simulation terminated. Simulation terminated. Waternoose: Wha...? (INT. SIMULATOR/TRYOUT ROOM. Behind the fourth wall of the SIMULATOR, the TRYOUT ROOM is filled with yellow-suited CDA agents. Mike sits in the evaluator's chair)
Mike: Well, I don't know about the rest of you guys but I spotted several big mistakes. Waternoose: (STAMMERS) But, but, but how did?
Mike: You know what? Let's watch my favorite part again... Shall we? (Mike rewinds the tape and plays it)
Waternoose: (repeating): I'll kidnap a thousand children before I let this company die! (Waternoose sees himself on the monitor) Waternoose: What...? Wha...? Waternoose: I'll kidnap a thousand children before... (The CDA agents discuss the situation) (Boo peeks out from under the bed. Sulley motions for her to stay quiet. She nods and crawls back) (CDA agents walk onto the stage and grab Waternoose)
CDA Agent: I'll get him. All right, come with us, sir.
Waternoose: What are you doing? Take your hands off me! You can't arrest me! (The CDA agents lead Waternoose out of the simulator room) I hope you're happy, Sullivan! You've destroyed this company! Monsters Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream now? The energy crisis will only get worse! Because of YOU!
(Sullivan is clearly troubled by Waternoose's words) Lead CDA Agent: Stay where you are. Number one wants to talk to you. (to other CDA) Attention! (Sulley and Mike exchange a confused look) (A PARADE OF AGENTS enter the room, standing at attention. As the last two enter, they make room for...)
Roz: Hello, boys. (Sulley and Mike's mouths drop open)
BOTH: Roz?
Roz: 2 1/2 years of undercover work were almost wasted when you intercepted that child, Mr. Sullivan. Of course, without your help, I never would have known that this went all the way up to Waternoose. (Boo scampers up to Sulley. Nearby CDA agents nervously step away) Roz: Now... About the girl... (Sulley scoops Boo up in his arms) Sulley: I just want to send her home. Roz: Very good. (into wrist communicator) Bring me a door shredder. Sulley: What, you mean... You mean, I can't see her again? Roz: That's the way it has to be. I'll give you five minutes.
