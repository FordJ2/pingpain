# pingpain

Taking advantage of Discord's API and json files, ***pingpain*** brings a new meaning to the world elaborate. ***pingpain*** has two main features that really define what this bot is. The first is activated by `p]plink`, and it ghost pings a random person in that channel every two hours. The second is activated by `p]troll`, and it sends the entirety of a random choice from three different movie scripts. Oh, and you can change the bot's prefix to whatever you want. Just ping the bot to find out its prefix is in that server.


Use `p]help` for more information.
